NZBcli v0.1
===========
Search and download nzb's from the commandline.


DESCRIPTION:

NZBcli is a small, basic commandline tool to search and download newsgroup releases. It relies heavily on the api from the newsgroup indexer newznab. It should
work fine on similar sites making use of a similar API (some adjustments might be necesarry).


SABNZBD INTEGRATION:

NZBcli also has very basic sabnzbd integration. The user can chose nzb's from the results and send them directly to sabnzbd.


CONFIGURATION:

For NZBcli to work you need to edit the included nzbcli.cfg.example file and move it to your home directory: ~/.nzbcli.cfg.


USAGE EXAMPLE:

    $ NZBcli 'Life and Times of Tim s01e01' -c 'HDTV'


BUGS:

IF only NZBCli were a wolf instead of a python, she'd be the leader of
the pack. But alas, that isn't the case, so, there will be bugs, lots!
Please report them, much appreciated.
